# Data Structures & Algorithms in Go

I've implemented (and reimplemented) several data structures and algorithms in Go 
with the purpose of gaining a deeper understanding of both DSA and Go itself.

Included are basic data structures such as a heap and stack implementation and some
algorithms including quicksort. Quicksort in particular, I spent several days
experimenting with running in paralell to better understand its functionality, Go's
method of concurrent execution, and paralell execution in general.
